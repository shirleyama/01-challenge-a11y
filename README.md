HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor - making code accessible

## Description 
The Horiseon Marketing Agency desktop website was refactored to make it more accessible so that everyone has more or less equal an access to it. The marketing agency provides SEO and therefore made sense that their own codebase meet standards set for good search engine optimisation. 

It was built with HTML, CSS which are essential for building web pages. It also uses GIT which used for tracking version control.  

Some of the challenges faced was trying to write meaningful Acceptance Criteria given the scenario.

It would be great to test the website with the Mac screenreader VoiceOver to see how the website would appear to a visually impaired person, and whether it can be improved even further.
